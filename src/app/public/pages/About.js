                        Students in Grades 6â€“8 in Ontario's elementary schools
                        are invited to participate in the Hackathon, which will
                        provide them with an enjoyable opportunity to test their
                        knowledge and compete with one another. It will be
                        housed in Port Credit Secondary School and run by the
                        Peel District School Board. The event will take over one
                        day in May of 2024. Students will have a fantastic
                        opportunity to learn more about Peel Schools,
                        particularly Port Credit's SciTech program, through this
                        challenge.
